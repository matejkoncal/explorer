## Installation

To compile and use Explorer, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed. This includes Rust and Cargo. If you don't have them installed, you can follow the official Rust installation guide: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Usage

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can compile and run Explorer using the following command:

```
explorer
```

After compilation, you need to add the path to the binary file to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to run Explorer from any directory in your command prompt or terminal.
